# ProtectU - Catastrophe Support System

## Concept

With this application, it’s generally intended to inform the users about catastrophes,
mainly war situations in the world. After the group discussion about the topic to be
developed, a search for applications with the same purpose was carried out, having only
found the application “LiveUMap”. So, after comparison, it was observed that there
were some similarities, having added features/improvements such as the chat, panic
button, war statistics, sensors, tutorial, user publications, recommendations and
accessibility to the population with the deficiencies described above. With these
additional features, it’s intended that the application becomes more accessible to the
population and that they can become more informed.
